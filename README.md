# Estimate the salary of a data scientist is the US
Creating a tool that can estimate the salary of data scientists in the US by scraping data from Glassdoor.com.  
(Currently only for US. I'll try to do the same for India as well)  
For the Indian version I'll have to search an other method to scrape data from Glassdoor since the websites for both the countries are different and I've configured Selenium to work with only the US website using the article mentioned below.
